# Job board scrapper
This project is a backend for https://github.com/PiotrO9/job_board <br />
Main purpose is scrapping data from https://nofluffjobs.com/pl
## Tech stack
I use Node.js and Express.js for building base of application. Scraping is available by Puppeteer.js
## How to run?
1) git clone https://github.com/PiotrO9/job_board_scrapper.git
2) npm install
3) node index.js
### Important information
Because of there is no free hosting where host app with puppeteer.js library is possible, to run whole project you have to download backend and frontend locally <br />
